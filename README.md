# labs.wearedevs.ai

Feedback hub for experiments in WeAreDevelopers Labs.  
<https://labs.wearedevs.ai>

No code here — just issues and discussions.

Right now that’s mainly the Video Search beta.  
Tell us what’s good, what’s broken, and what’s missing.  
Details help — URLs, timestamps, browser/device info, steps to reproduce.

We’re shipping early, learning in the open, and moving fast.  
If it’s rough, that’s fine. That’s the point.

## How to give feedback
Raw details are best — links, timestamps, browser/device info, and exact steps help a lot.
